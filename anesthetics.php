                        <p>Anesthesia is a medical treatment that prevents patients from feeling pain during procedures like surgery, certain screening and diagnostic tests, tissue sample removal (e.g., skin biopsies), and dental work. It allows people to have procedures that lead to healthier and longer lives.

To produce anesthesia, doctors use drugs called anesthetics. Scientists have developed a collection of anesthetic drugs with different effects. These drugs include general, regional, and local anesthetics. General anesthetics make patients unconscious during the procedure while local and regional anesthetics just numb part of the body and allow patients to remain awake.

Depending on the type of pain relief needed, doctors deliver anesthetics by injection, inhalation, topical lotion, spray, eye drops, or skin patch.

                    <div class="overview-p">
                        <p>During General Anesthesia, medications are given so patients are unconscious (“asleep”) and unable to feel any pain during the surgical procedure. Some of these medications are given through an IV and others are gases administered through a breathing mask or tube with oxygen.  Some of the side effects of general anesthesia include nausea, vomiting, sore throat, muscle aches, shivering and confusion. General anesthesia is the most common type of anesthetic administered.  </p>

                        <p>Regional Anesthesiology entails injecting a local anesthetic near nerves to numb a portion of the body.  There are several types of regional anesthetics including spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia and various specific nerve blocks.  When Regional Anesthesia is used, patients  may be awake, sedated  or put to sleep for their surgical procedure.  </p>

                        <p>This is a combination technique that puts you to sleep and provides pain control, not only during the procedure, but afterwards as well. The placement of the epidural catheter allows for you to have continued pain relief after surgery, which will help you sleep and to move more comfortably after surgery. This type of anesthesia is commonly used for major abdominal and thoracic (chest) procedures. The epidural catheter may be left in place for several days  after your surgery.

                        <p>Monitored Anesthsia Care involves the injection of medications through an IV catheter to help you relax, as well as to block pain. A combination of sedative and narcotic medications are used to help you tolerate a procedure that otherwise would be uncomfortable. In addition, the surgeon may inject a local anesthetic at the site of the procedure for pain control.Type of anesthesia, you are able to respond to questions,but will be drowsy throughout the procedure.

                        <p>Any known allergies. Discussing any known allergies with the anesthesiologist is very important, as some anesthetic drugs trigger cross-allergies, particularly in people who have allergies to eggs and soy products. Allergies to both foods and drugs should be identified.
