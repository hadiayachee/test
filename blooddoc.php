                        <p>Blood banking is the process that takes place in the lab to make sure that donated blood, or blood products, are safe before they are used in blood transfusions and other medical procedures. Blood banking includes typing the blood for transfusion and testing for infectious diseases.
                            While the first blood transfusions were made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation, it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to store it for some days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks. John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at St Mary's Hospital, London, in the late 19th century. His attempts, using phosphate of soda, however, were unsuccessful.

                        <p>O positive is the most common blood type as around 35% of our blood donors have it.

                            The second most common blood type is A positive (30%), while AB negative (1%) is the rarest.
                            Anyone with an Rh positive blood type can receive O positive red blood cells – so that’s A positive, B positive and AB positive as well as O positive.

                            That means 3 in 4 people, or around 76% of the population, can benefit from your donation.
                            People with O positive blood can receive donations from

O positive blood donors and
O negative blood donors.

                            Air ambulances and emergency response vehicles carry O negative supplies for emergencies. Collecting enough O negative blood is a constant challenge and we always need your donations.
                            O negative donors are often called ‘universal donors’ because anyone can receive the red blood cells from their donations.

                            Although about 8% of the population has O negative blood, it accounts for around 13% of hospital requests for red blood cells.
                            People with O negative blood can only receive red cell donations from O negative .
